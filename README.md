# spotify-template
This template is an optional starting point for a challenge for the following [course](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/) at the University of Washington.  The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).


What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

This project allows students to practice using other API that have already been created, as well as getting familiar with accessing large data to turn into valuable information.

My project specifically allows users to preview songs through searches, displaying the album image, as well as allows for volume adjustment. I think this assignment really helped me understand API better, and I will definitely consider using Youtube to implement something similar. :D

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
I spent about 10 hours working on this assignment.
Most of the time I soloed this assignment except for some helpful guidance from the friendly internet about how to use the API as well as how to implement audio visuals.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Not that I know of?
